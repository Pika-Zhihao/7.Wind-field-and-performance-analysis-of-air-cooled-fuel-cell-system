1. This project is my undergraduate thesis.
It aims to explore wind field simulation and battery performance analysis within the microchannels of a fuel cell.

2. Hefei University of Technology holds a license for Fluent, and the entire simulation
and analysis process was performed using Fluent. Data analysis was performed using Matlab
and Python (Hefei University of Technology also holds the relevant licenses for these software).

3. The purpose of creating this project is to enhance my learning and improvement of Fluent
wind field simulation. No other commercial purposes or conflicts of interest exist.

4. This project includes the original undergraduate thesis and project summary
(Project 7. Wind-field-and-performance-analysis-of-air-cooled-fuel-cell-system),
as well as the original fuel cell model.
